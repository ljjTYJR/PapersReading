This md file is matained for the following consideration:
- After reading some papers, I often feel confused: How to continue to work and how to come up with new idea. And more important, how these authors come up with ideas and how they will continue to do. Do they have a long-term vision in their work? ---- Based on this consideration, I decide to follow some systemantic work, some author and some lab. To see what other outstanding people think and organize their work.

I expect learn the following points from their work:
- Get a overview / systemantic idea of an area, which can help me understand the whole progress of the area, instead of just knowing a small area of my research area.
- Learn how to think in a long-term view, how to arrange my next work.
- Follow a systemantic work can also help me think in a systemantic way, which is beneficial for deep understanding in the area.

Anyway, a systemantic view and deep understanding are what I lack now.



Follow ways:

- Follow exact someone's work. Since for a PHD student, he often focus on some exact work and extend it during his phd career. So, it is a good idea to follow some Phd's publications.
- Follow some lab. The work of a lab may be a little wider. Compared to someone's work, lab's work sometimes include more things. But the whole idea are similar, so it is also a good idea to dollow some lab's work.
