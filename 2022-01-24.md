    - Compared to correspondence-free metrics (ICP, GO-ICP), more accurate and faster;
    - Provide Certification;

    Cons:

    - Need correspondence, if the correspondence(provided by FPFH) is not very good, the result is bad.

  - In our method, fuzzy clusters are utilized to represent a scan, and the registration of two given scans is realized by minimizing a fuzzy weighted sum of the distances between their fuzzy cluster centres.

  - Use a coarse-to-fine framework, BnBs to get a global registration and provide a good initialization for refinement. (coarse: centre-to-centre; fine: point-to-centre)

  > - The FCM-based metric can be regarded as point-to-point ICP; The GK-based metric can be regarded as point-to-plane ICP.

  需要补充一些额外的数学知识，没看懂。。

  另外，看起来 optimal transport 要想用在点云配准里面，是需要知道correspondence的，可以说是一种优化手段吧。

  - Use persistent point feature histograms to describe a feature point in a point set.

    - Four features are extracted to describe a feature point. (3 angels based on norm, 1based on distance);
    - The ratio is computed and shown in histograms, which can be used as a vector;

  - By analyzing the persistence of the features at different scales, we extract an optimal set that best characterizes a given point cloud.

    - By comparing the point with global description.

    - > In order to select the best feature points for a given cloud, we analyze the neighbourhood of each point p multiple times, by enclosing p on a sphere of radius ri and p as its centre. We vary rover an interval depending on the point cloud size and density and compute the local point feature histograms for every point.

    - > By comparing the feature histogram of each point against the *µ-histogram* using a distance metric (see below), and building a distribution of distances (see Figure 8 – note that it can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution), we can perform a statistical analysis of each feature’s persistence over multiple radii.

  - Pros and cons

    - pros

      - By using a higher dimensionality (16D) for characterizing the local geometry at a point p, the estimated features are robust in the presence of outliers and invariant to the position, orientation, or sampling density of the cloud.
      - Expressive enough.

    - cons

      - > For real-time or near real-time applications, however, the computation of Point Feature Histograms in dense point neighbourhoods can represent one of the major bottlenecks in the registration framework.

  - Simplified *PFH* algo, which reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm from  $O(n\cdot k^2)$ to $O(n·k)$;

    <img src="D:\papers\notes\FPFH.png" alt="./notes/FPFH.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

  - Pros and cons

    - Pros: Compared to FPH, it reduce the computational cost.
    - Cons: Handcrafted features are generally designed to work with relatively clean range data like laser scans, and may not work very well with the scans collected by commodity depth sensors

  - :yellow_heart: Just roughly reading
  - Add two extensions to standard *Hough Transform*: 1) The *intrinsic Hough transform* which reduces the memory consumption; 2) *minimum-entropy Hough transform* which increases the detection accuracy.

  - Our model is specifically designed to handle (also) point-cloud pairs with low overlap.
  - The core of the model is an overlap attention module that enables early information exchange between the point clouds’ latent encodings, in order to infer which of their points are likely to lie in their overlap region.

  - Invariants:
    - Curvature
      - simplicity and efficiency;
      - sensitivity to both sensor noise and sampling rate;
    - Moment
    - Spherical Harmonics
  - How:
    - Calculate the correspondence points instead of finding the closest points.

  - First, the proposed metric is based on intersections of uniformly random straight lines set in space, which can obtain richer information and more likely to achieve the global minimum.
- Second, our proposed metric can turn various supervised learning frameworks into unsupervised and has the
    ability to train on massive real unlabeled suitable data sets.
  - Pros and Cons
  - More accurate and faster than ICP, FGR.
