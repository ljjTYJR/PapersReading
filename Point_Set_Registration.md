  - Summary

    - The method changes point set coordinate stochastically every iteration:
      $$
      p_j' = p_j + v_j
      $$
      The perturbation is generated by Gaussian Noise.

    - The stop criteria is the transformation parameter error between two iteration is small.

  Tr-ICP: '*Tr*' means the '*Trimmed*', use the '*[Least Trimmed Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_trimmed_squares)*' method in the process to improve robustness.
  Pros: can converge when the **overlapping** rate is under 50%;
  cons: still need a good initial pose;

  - Summary

    - Traditional ICP method uses the *Least Square* to compute the objective function. If we define the residuals as $e_1 = p_1 - q_1$ , the traditional ICP is $e_1^2 + e_2^2 + e_3^2$

      The M-ICP constructs a new objective function as:
      $$
      Obj = \sum{\rho_1(e_1)+\rho_2(e_2)+\rho_3(e_3)}
      $$

  - Summary

    - The proposed mthod combines the color information into the distance metric based on ICP algorithm. The color parameters are represented by *YIQ* color model. Because it can separate the intensity(which may be affected by the light.) and the intrinsic color.

    - The distance can be computed by
      $$
      p = (x_1,x_2,x_3,\alpha_1c_1, \alpha_2c_2, \alpha_3c_3)
      $$
      Where $\alpha$ is the coefficient, and the $c$ is the measure of color.

  - SPC problem: simultaneous pose and correspondence problem. But if given the correspondence, or given the rotation matrix, the problem becomes **convex** which is easy to solve. SPC problem is non-convex.

  - This paper regard many existing algorithms(e.g. ICP) as a kind of **E-M** algorithm, which alternatively estimate the correspondence and the transformation. The original problem is divided into two sub-problems. However, the E-M algorithms are **local optimal**.

  - Some other existing approaches(Exploiting the geomertic features thar are **inariant** to either **correspondence**? or **transformation**): [PCA](Kazhdan, Michael, Thomas Funkhouser, and Szymon Rusinkiewicz. "Shape matching and anisotropy." *ACM SIGGRAPH 2004 Papers*. 2004. 623-629.), [Mondal matching and spectural matching](M. Leordeanu and M. Hebert, "A spectral technique for correspondence problems using pairwise constraints", *ICCV*, vol. 2, pp. 1482-1489, 2005.    &&    S. Sclaroff and A. Pentland, "Model matching for correspondence and recognition", *PAMI*, June 1995.)

  - The core idea of this paper is the theory of **Lipschitz optimization**.

  - The above problems mentioned above:

    - If the correspondence is fixed, the problem can be solved by: RANSAC, [quaternion method](B. Horn, "Closed-form solution of absolute orientation using unit quatemions", *JOSA-A*, vol. 4, pp. 629-642, April 1987.) [colsed-form1](D. W. Eggert, A. Lorusso and R. B. Fisher, "Estimating 3-d rigid body transformations: a comparison of four major algorithms", *Machine Vision and Applications*, vol. 9, pp. 272-290, 1997.) [closed-form2]( N. Ohta and K. Kanatani, "Optimal estimation of three-dimensional rotation and reliability evaluation", *ECCV*, pp. 175-187, June 1998.)
    - if the Rotation is fixed, the correspondence can also be solved(Here I do not write here, it can be regarded as a pure mathematical problem)

  - To globally optimize the problem, two ways can be considered:

    - Search all the permutations, and then solve the rotation. This idea is simple and effiective, but the cons is that if the input's size is large, the searching space's size is $n!$.
    - Search the rotation space and slove foe the correspondence, which uses the Lipschitz optimization and Brounch-and-bound algorithm.

  - For the brounch-and-bound algorithm, in my view, it estimate the lower bound of each interval and choose the lower bound, and iteratively search the space until converge.

    :question: The details of the algorithm I have not understood.

  - Pros and cons:

    - pros: Global optimal, insensitive to the initialization.
    - cons: 1) Time consuming. 2) Senstive to the outlier. 3) The algorithm complexity is unkown.

  - Can be considered as the pre-paper for the Go-ICP

  - Summary

    - The algorithm aims to accelerate the ICP process. Two methods are used: 

      > At a coarse resolution (i.e., with a limited number of points) ICP converges faster but with less accuracy than at a fine resolution. However, by initializing a finer-resolution ICP with the result of the coarser one, the convergence of the fine-resolution ICP is much faster than with a single-shot ICP, as the initial alignment is mostly correct. These authors also used a pre-computed list of NN to approximate the matching step. With both of these techniques, they showed a significant increase of the speed of ICP while maintaining adequate robustness

  - Summary

    - Integrating color information into GICP. The pointwise color is represented by *L\*a\*b\* color space*. The point is represented as:
      $$
      p_{\alpha,i} = (x_i, y_i, z_i, \alpha L_i, \alpha a_i, \alpha b_i)^{T}
      $$
      The distance of two point is represented as :
      $$
      d_i = || p_{\alpha,i} - q_{\alpha,i}||_{2}
      $$

    The method is used in finding correspondences.

  - Pros and cons

    - Compared to GICP, the proposed method is more accurate.
    - The running time arises.

  - Comments

    - GICP reduces the distances of corresponding points in the direction of the surface normals.

  - Summary

    - The difference between the proposed method and *point-to-plane* method is the optimization. Different from *least square solution*, the proposed method uses a closed-form solution to optimize which makes the converge quicker.

  - Summary

    <img src="./notes/VGICP.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

    - The proposed is based on G-ICP(Which first computes the covariance of each point in the two point sets.) Then the GICP finds nearest point and optimizes the cost function combined with the covariance. NDT firstly divides the raw point set into fixed grids, and computes covariance of each grid(a distribution), then finds the nearest gird to optimize the cost function.

    - VGICP

      - Compute the covariance of each point in point sets.

      - For the fixed set, the mean value and covariance is computed together. (Maybe it can be viewed as a "distribution of distribution?").

      - Acceleration: Instead of searching the nearest point/grid. The method uses a trick of voxelization:
        $$
        voxel\_index\_a = cast\_to\_int(a_i / voxle\_resolution) \\
        voxel\_index\_b = cast\_to\_int(b_i / voxle\_resolution) \\
        $$
        In each iteration, the point in moving set will find the equal index in b to optimize.

    - Pros:

      - Run in parallel because it does not need to search the nearest point every iteration.

  - Summary
    - The proposed method follows the iteration process of ICP method.
      - The difference: In ICP, the correspondence is provided by finding the nearest points correspondence. But in this paper, the correspondence is estimated by finding the *feature correspondence*.  The features are provided by *Binary Shape Context (BSC)*. 
      - The process of features correspondence can be summarized by: 1) Keypoints detecting; 2) computing the descriptors. 3) Computing the correspondence by miniminzing a energy function.
      - After getting the correspondence, SVD is used to compute the transformation.
  - Pros and cons
    - From the experiments, the features seem to hadle **partial overlap** well.
    - The method need involve feature correspondence computation, it is really **time consuming**.

  - Summary

    - Maybe due to the density or other things, the location error of corresponding points may be anisotropic. The previous method mainly consider the location error as the isotropic error.

    - To formulate the metric error, the anisotropic consideration is combined into the steps of the iteration:
      $$
      distance:d_{new} = || W_{\vec{x}\vec{y}}(\vec{x}-\vec{y})||_{2}^2\\
      cost function = \sum_{i=1}^{M}||W_{i}(R\vec{x_i}+\vec{t}-\vec{y}_{corresponding})||_2^2
      $$
      The coefficient is related to the covariance of both inputs' covariance

    - How to compute the covariance? —— **PCA**

  - Cons:

    - PCA computes covariance consume too much time.

  - Summary

    - The *new* of the proposed method is because it is different ICP methods which defines linear association. The method introduces the *soft-assignment* to the point set registration.
    - To relax the discrete optimization by introducing the *softmax* function to describe the the assignment matrix. Then using the *deterministic annealing* to estimating the parameter matrix. (Nested iteration).
    - To estimate the transformation parameter, coordinate descent is used.

  - **Formulation**:

    The registration is presented as a engery function(cost function):
    $$
    E = \sum_{j=1}^{J}\sum_{k=1}^{K} m_{jk} (|| X_j -t -AY_k||_{2}^{2} - \alpha)
    $$

​			In the formulation, the term $m_{jk}$ represents the assignment of the point $i$ and $j$. The parameter $\alpha$ can be regarded as the 	*threshold* for outlier rejecting.

​			**Optimization**: Colsed-form solution is got directly(Analytical solution by equating partial derivatives = 0)

  - Summary:

    - This method is similar to CPD, the difference is that in this algorithm(which is called **ECM**), the **isotropic covariance** is replaced by **anisotropic covariance**. To solve the problem of estimating $R$ under the case of anisotropic covariance, the orthogonal constraint is put on the rotation matrix, and get the estimation of $R$ by *SDP*.
    - The reason the author mentions using the anisotropic covariance is to treat the covariance as a parameter of the model and to be optimized in the *E-M* process. The former methods use isotropic covariance combined with annealing where covariance works as a parameter of the process of annealing.
  
  - Cons:
  
    - Other papers mention that using anisotropic covariance improve little in fact.
  
  - The paper has some assumptions which are interesting:
  
    - This paper treat the algorithm as a **Cluster and parameter estimation** problem. The root can be referred to:

    - Using the isotropic covariance has two advantages:
  
      - With isotropic covariance, the Mahalanobis Distance is replaced by Euclidean Distance, the rotation can be computed in a closed-form way.
  
      - The isotropic covariance can be combined with annealing. 
  
        > **The drawback**: Anisotropic noise in the data is not properly handled, it does not use the full Gaussian model, and it does not fully benefit from the convergence properties ofEMbecause it anneals the variance
        > rather than considering it as a parameter to be estimated
  
  - Some more considerations:
  
    - Replacing the EM process by **CEM**, which means *Classification EM*, forcing posterior probability to 0/1.
    - Finding the connection to ICP.
    - Some ways to accelerate E-step: *block-like organizations* or *KD-trees*.

  - **SVR**
  - Summary
    - The method uses a *SVM* to generate two GMMs for the two point sets.(Compared to GMMReg, the GMMs components do not equal to the number of the points). The two GMMs have the same covariance, (Every component has the same covariance).
    - Similar to GMMReg, registration is conducted by minimizing the L2 distance between two GMMs. The transformation parameter is updated by gradient-based method(*interior-reflective Newton* method). The covariance $\sigma$ works as the annealingp arameter.
  - Pros
    - The GMM constructed by the SVM is more robust especially for occlusion.

  - Considering the local features(provided by *FPFH*) as the prior knowledge to give a prio estimation of parameter if $\pi_{mn}$ in the process of *E-M* process of algorithm of CPD;
  
    - In the original paper, $\pi_{mn}$ is given in the uniform form: $\pi_{mn}=\frac{1}{N}$ , but this paper demonstrates that the $\pi_{mn}$ can be calculated by $\pi_{mn}=\frac{\tau}{|D|}$, where $|D|$ is the corresponding features' number of the point.
  
      > Here, the author changes the prior estimation, there is also related work about changing the covariance about the local structure, where can be found in [[LSG-CPD]](./papers/LSG-CPD Coherent Point Drift with Local Surface Geometry.pdf)
  
    - In the *M* step, the parameter can be obtained by calculate the partial derviation directly. The difficulty lies in the non-rigid term, in the original paper, the author adds a regularization term to form a smotthness. <u>The transformation is calculated by solving a linear system</u>.

  - This paper view the problem in a different view. The CPD or GMM view the point set registration as a *point fitting probaility model* problem, to estimate the parameter. But in this paper, the author view the problem as a *cluster* problem. Many point sets together find the cluster model.
  
  - The covariance is a by-product which can be used to smooth the result( Rejecting the outliers. )
  
  - cons:
  
    - The experiments show that the four points with 1200 points need to take 20+s to get the result. (Compared to the GMM, ICP seems always more efficient). Mainly beacuse GMM-based methods involve much computation(Matrix and Exponentiation)

  - Summary:
    - <img src="./notes/adaptive_density.png" style="zoom:50%;" />
    - The method is based on *JRMPC* (It firstly construct GMM clusters and register point sets by estimating cluster parameters. Also similar to fuzzy-cluster, the difference is to use GMM cluster or fuzzy cluster). 
    - In real sensors, the points are sparse in remote areas, and points are dense in close areas, which will result in more clusters in dense areas. These uneven samples will result in inaccurate registration.
    - The paper uses a latent distribution to replace the original sample distribution by minimizing *K-L Divergence* to get a relatively uniform distribution. In practice, an extra term $f(x)$ is added in the GMM as a kind of weight.
  - Pros:
    - Compared to baseline methods(JR-MPC), the proposed method performs better in real datasets.
  - Related work and comments
    - To solve the uneven samples, there are also many other ways:
      - Re-sample: Divide the point set into many many **girds**, and compute the *mean* point for each grid. (Looks like the NDT method). The **shortcomings** of the method: It neglects the original geometric structure of the point set, And it is hard to tune the parameter such as grid size.
  - :train2: Can be used in other algorithms.

  - Summary:
    - <img src="./notes/her-gmm.png" style="zoom:50%;" />
    - This paper is about how to represent a 3-D point set. The author proposes to use the *Hierarchy of Gaussian Mixtures*.
    - The main consideration of *Hierarchy* is a trade-off between *Fidelity* and *memory usage*. 
    - The authors are from *Nvidia*, the hierarchical representation is beneficial to computing parallelly by GPU, which results in *accelerated* in the title.
  - Comments
    - Representing continuous geometry through voxels creates discretization artifacts and offers no clear way of handling
      noise or data uncertainty.
    - Furthermore, the discrete nature of voxels and sub-sampled point clouds greatly complicate spatial processing procedures that require continuous derivatives or high-quality normal estimates.
    - Voxelization and occupancy grids [6, 19] have been established as a popular method to discretize raw PCD over a dense grid, but memory problems emerge when needing fine resolution or large grids. Many voxels may be unoccupied, leading to inefficient memory usage.
    - (KD-trees and Oct-trees): These structures incur additional overhead compared to dense grids, however, requiring superlinear construction time with respect to the size of the PCD.
    - (NDT): Though the construction of such a data structure is very efficient, the requirement to voxelize at the beginning
      can cause a loss of fidelity.

  - Summary:
    - <img src="P:\PapersReading\notes/HGMR.png" style="zoom:50%;" />
    - The consideration of the paper shows above: the deterministic division of point sets can not represent the raw point set well.
    - The algorithm is based on the hierarchical GMM model to accelerate the posterior estimation. The algorithm uses the covariance of the cluster to describe the geometry property of the cluster which can be used to decide the level of the cluster. The covariance of the Gaussian model has three eigenvalue $\lambda_{1} \lambda_{2} \lambda_{3}$, if $\lambda_{3} << \lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}$, this Gaussian model can be viewed very similar to a planar, and no need to divide in deeper.
  - Comments
    - ICP and its dozens of variants [34] often fail to produce correct results in many common but challenging scenarios, where the presence of noise, uneven point density, occlusions, or when large pose displacements can cause a large proportion of points to be without valid matches.
    - but these algorithms(statistical methods) tend to be much slower than ICP and often offer only marginal improvement in all but a few specific circumstances. As a result, ICP-based methods are still heavily used
      in practice for many real-world applications.
    - Intuitively, we can view EM as a statistical generalization of ICP: The E Step estimates data associations, replacing ICP’s matching step, while the M Step maximizes the expected likelihood conditioned on these data associations, replacing ICP’s distance minimization step over matched pairs.
    - Under a single scale, the point cloud modeling and matching process might succumb to noise or sampling inadequacies if the given modeling fidelity is not appropriate to the local data distribution.
  - Cons:
    - But it does not account for outliers in its probabilistic modeling, making it not robust to outliers and missing points.
  - Tips:
    - The covariance of the Gaussian model can be used to describe the geometric features of the point cluster.
  - TODO: (:question:)
    - How to solve the optimization need more read.
  - :train2: Can be used in other algorithms.

    <img src="./notes/deepgmr_net.png" style="zoom:50%;"/>
  
    - The author proposes a network $f_{\psi}$ to work as an *E* step in the *E-M* framework to classify a point and the Gaussian cluster it belongs to. The two following computing blocks $M_{\theta}$ and $M_{T}$ work as the *M* step in the *E-M* framework.
    - The *E-M* framework is different from previous methods which find the correspondence between points-to-clusters or clusters-to-clusters. But find a deterministic correspondence between clusters? (:question: How?)
  
  - Comments:
  
    - The major difficulty of global registration lies in data association.
  
    - In addition, real-world point clouds don’t contain exact point-level correspondences due to sensor noise.
  
    - FPFH features used in [48] rely on consistent normal estimation, which is difficult to obtain in practice due to varying sparsity or non-rectilinear geometry.
  
    - Moreover, these sparse correspondences are still point-level and suffer the same problem when exact point-level correspondences don’t exist.
  
    - However, the iterative EM procedure makes it much more computationally expensive.
  
    - *<u>This is because Eq. 6 used in the E Step performs point-to-cluster correspondence based on locality, i.e. a point likely belongs to a component if it is close to the component’s center, which leads to spurious data association between Pˆ and Θ∗ when T is large.</u>*

  - Summary

    <img src="./notes/Rotation-invariant2.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

    <img src="./notes/rotation-variant-translation.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

    - The method aims to find the global optimal transformation by decomposition to translation $t^*$, rotation $R^*$. Specifically, computing $R^*$ firstly by search the translation-invariants features space(point-wise normals). After getting $R^*$, using it to compute $t^*$ to search translation space by BnB.

      ```mermaid
      graph LR
      	T((R,t)) --Rot-invariant --> A[R*] --> B[t*]
      ```

    - $R^*$ :
      - pointwise **normals**: vonMises-Fisher mixture models (vMF-MM) **Used to model angle distribution**. 
      - **Rotation space representation** 
      - Distribution-to-distribution; **Numbers of Model: nonparametric method automatically.**
    - $t^*$ : DP(Dirichlet process)Gaussian mixure model(GMM).

  - Why

    - DP(Dirichlet process)
      - Automatically compute the numbers of mixtures.
      - This allows adaptive compression of the data, enabling the processing of large **noisy** point clouds, (is a kind of way to compressing data)
    - Decomposition: Efficiency (Two low-dimension searching space *VS* one high-dimension searching space)
      - Based on a invariant features.
    - Rotation Searching Space: Less overlap, more accurate subdivision, faster.

  - Comments:

    - BB requires three major components: (1) a tessellation method for covering the optimization domain with subsets; (2) a branch/refinement procedure for subdividing any subset into smaller subsets; and (3) upper and lower bounds of the maximum objective on each subset to be used for pruning.
    - About the representation of rotation space: 
      - axis-angle (AA) space:  First, it covers 46% of rotation space twice. Second, it does not lead to uniform tessellation in rotation space.

  - Coms

    - The complicated mixture models introduce heavy computation.

  - Usuage

    - The proposed distribution of estimating the distribution of normals can be used in SLAM.

    - Summary

      - This papar proposes a partition depending on the points' semantic lables. (1DNT or many NDTs?)
        - The semantic labels are *edge* and *plane*.
        - The point will be put a value reveals confidence.
        - :question: How many NDTs will be constructed?
      - The registration process does not find the closet NDT, but find the NDTs with the same label. 

    - Pros

      - Fitst, the points with no labels will be filtered out, resulting less points and faster registration. 
      - Second, only registering the NDTs with the same label will result int more accurate result.

    - Experiments

      - The experiments are conducted on KITTI(SLAM) and ETH. 

        - KITTI provides the ground truth and provide the evaluation metric. **Features:** SLAM, outdoor, large overlap.

          **Do we need to modify the dataset?**

  - Summary
    - This paper propose a registration method using global features to register point sets. The paper claims that it can handle the registration problem in the case of overlap is about 40%(Low overlap.)
    - The features extraction are realized by *EGI(Extended Gaussian Image)*, it is a kind of *distribution* to represent the directional variable(Though this paper describe it by histogram). The rotation estimation is then computed by optimizing correletion of two histograms. (By the way, this kind of features is translation-invariant).
    - Translation is computed based on the rotation got from step 2.

  - In our method, fuzzy clusters are utilized to represent a scan, and the registration of two given scans is realized by minimizing a fuzzy weighted sum of the distances between their fuzzy cluster centers.
  - Use a coarse-to-fine framework, BnBs to get a global registration and provide a good initialization for refinement.(coarse: center-to-center; fine: point-to-center)

  - Use persistent point feature histograms to describe a feature point in a point set.
  
    - Four features are extracted to describe a feature point.(3 angels based on norm, 1based on distance);
    - The ration is computed and showed in histograms, which can be used as a vector;
  
  - By analyzing the persistence of the features at different scales, we extract an optimal set which best characterizes a given point cloud.
  
    - By comparing the point with global description.
  
    - > In order to select the best feature points for a given cloud, we analyze the neighborhood of each point p multiple times, by enclosing p on a sphere of radius ri and p as its center. We vary r over an interval depending on the point cloud size and density, and compute the local point feature histograms for every point.
  
    - > By comparing the feature histogram of each point against the *µ-histogram* using a distance metric (see below), and building a distribution of distances (see Figure 8 – note that it can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution) , we can perform a statistical analysis of each feature’s persistence over multiple radii.
  
  - Pros and cons
  
    - pros
  
      - By using a higher dimensionality (16D) for characterizing the local geometry at a point p, the estimated features are robust in the presence of outliers, and invariant to the position, orientation, or sampling density of the cloud.
      - Expressive enough.
  
    - cons
  
      - > For real-time or near real-time applications however, the computation of Point Feature Histograms in dense point neighborhoods can represent one of the major bottlenecks in the registration framework.

  - This paper gives an very direct and clear idea to find the correspondence between two transformmed point set: in the problem of rigid registration, the distance of a given point $x_i$ to other point $x_o$ will be the same with the corresponding point $y_i$ with other points $y_o$.
  - So if we construct the matrix which is of the size $M\times N$ $P$, the correspondence is described by a matrix P and the element of the matrix means the correspondence of the correspondending relationship between two points.
  - The problem is converted to a seperate combinational optimization problem.

  - Summary

    <img src="./notes/Rotation-Invariant.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

    - The method aims to find the global optimization for rigid pairwise optimization. The transformation is decomposed computing optimal translation and optimal rotation separately. Specifically,  optimal translation $t^*$ is computed first, and then rotation $r^*$ is computed then.

    - For computing $t^*$, the rotation-invariant features is constructed by two points $x_1$ and $x_2$:
      $$
      p_{i} = \{ |x_1|, |x_2|, |x_1 - x_2| \}^{T}
      $$
      is rotation invariant. Based on the consensus set constructed by two point sets. Constructed the cost function and optimized it by BnB-search to get optimal $t^*$ .

    - After finding the $t^*$, using local-method to compute $R$ or use *RANSAC* to get $R$ directly.

  - cons:

    - No code, the compared baseline methods are few.

  - Use an estimator called *scaled Geman-McClure estimator* to reject the outliers and noise
  - Induce the *Black-Rangarajan duality* to optimize the objective function
  - Faster and more accurate than ICP, no need to find the correspondence and closet in the inner loop.

  - Summary:
    - <img src="./notes/GMM-Feature.png" style="zoom:70%;"/>
    - Similar to GMMs with color, but the colour is replaced by feature. In general, there are two distributions to form a joint distribution: $p(x,y)$ —— $x$ is the sptial information, $y$ is the feature distribution. The nueral network set a point-wise feature and a weight.
    - For the network: Input: coordinate of points; Output: Featurs & weights. The feature distribution: von Mises-Fisher distribution.

  - Our model is specifically designed to handle (also) point-cloud pairs with low overlap.
  - The core of the model is an overlap attention module that enables early information exchange between the point clouds’ latent encodings, in order to infer which of their points are likely to lie in their overlap region.

  - This paper propose a registration algorithm based-on deep-learning.
  - It uses the network to find the inlier features(The used features provided by "FCGF"); Use a kind of function to calculate the coarse alignment; Use the gradient-based methods to get a find registration.
  - **Some thoughts:** The positions of the points can also be regarded as a kind of "features".

    - Three steps: 1) Features extraction; 2) Soft correspondence; 3) SVD compute transformation.

  - Why

    - Soft correspondence: differentiable.

  - cons

    - Object-level input.(Which means the size of input point set is about 500-5k points).

  - Summary
    - The **correspondence**: The input is pair-points, the motivation is similar *PPF(hand crafter features)*, to find the local features. The output is the correspondence. These Networks aim to find invariant features.
    - How to compute the **transformation**: RANSAC
  - Comments
    - The **shortcomings** of the hand-crafted features: The hand-crafted features(such as *FPFH*) only consider the local features of the points, which may spread widely in the two point set, thus resulting in incorrect correspondence.
    - The author mentions that using set-input (pair or small patch) as the input of the network is beneficial to develop the invariance properties.

  - Summary

    - About the method: [Some paper](./papers/Robust_Point_Set_Registration_Using_Gaussian_Mixture_Models.pdf) refers to it as *Graph Matching*. Some paper(*CPD*) refers it as probalistic method similar to *CPD*, but the difference lies in the solution of *M-step*. (The later one is widely accepted.)

  - Understanding(May not be correct)

    - **I think** the main idea is that the proposed method model the correspondence and the alignment as two probability. The algorithm follows a 2-step *E-M* process to compute the correspondence and alignment separately.

      The difference from the previous methods is the framework to update the correspondence and transformation parameters.

    - **Need to read the previous papers first**

  - The **evaluation** paper of the local features descriptors, in the introduction of the paper, the author mention the skeleton of the paper: What's is the local descriptors, and the relevant algorithms; How to evaluate the local features, the meaning of the evaluation. The contribution and why to write the paper.

  - 一些值得借鉴的东西：

    - 为什么要做这篇论文：

      - Although a large number of feature descriptors have been proposed, they were exclusively designed for a specific **application** scenario.
      - they have only been tested on a limited number of **datasets.**
      - It is therefore, very challenging for **developers** to choose an **appropriate** descriptor for their particular appli-
        cation
      - Most of these evaluation articles tested only a small number of 3D local feature descriptors and for a specific application domain.

      —— 1) 选定的算法数目更多；2) 选定的测试集更多，之前的evaluation要么限定在某一两个测试环境，要么选定的算法比较少，无法做到统一的评估；3) 有一些没有被测试(robustness)；

    - 自己要做什么包括：1) 选取的测试集一定要广泛；2) 选定的测试方法；3) 在实际的应用环境中进行测试（例如本文可以专注于某一个领域, robotics?)

  - This paper mainly propose a stadnard pipeline of ICP algorithms, and provbide a open-source sofrware which can be used for comparing ICP algorithms. The pipeline consists of different modules, which can be tuned by parameters.
  
  - However, the paper's foucus is narrow, the main contribution of the paper is the software. It research the variants of ICP little. The content is much but with no focus, the experiments are a little superficial.
  
  - If I were the author, I will refer to the paper 《Efficient ICP and its variants》,  this paper classify different metrics of ICP variants and compare the performance of these metrics. However, what I want to do？ I want to verify the real performance of these metrics. So, the baseline and the criteria should be established. What the problems they can solve?
  
    The limitations of the paper is that it is more engineering, but not the theoretical.
  
  - :question: However, how to express my idea if I wrote the paper?
  
    Refer to the paper: <secrets of optical flow> again! Though I can't get the content, but I should learn the main idea of it.
