# Point Set Registration for 3D Range Scans Using Fuzzy Cluster-based Metric and Efficient Global Optimization

## Pre-knowledge

- Fuzzy-clustering:

  > [[wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_clustering)

  > **Fuzzy clustering** (also referred to as **soft clustering** or **soft \*k\*-means**) is a form of clustering in which each [data point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point) can belong to more than one cluster.

  - Fuzzy C-means clustering(FCM)

- Expectation-maximization Algorithm(E-M)

## Methods

1. Applying fuzzy clustering to the two point set. 
2. Minimizing the corresponding fuzzy c-means objective function.
