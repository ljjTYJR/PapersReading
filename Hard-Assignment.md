  - Summary

    - The method changes point set coordinate stochastically every iteration:
      $$
      p_j' = p_j + v_j
      $$
      The perturbation is generated by Gaussian Noise.

    - The stop criteria is the transformation parameter error between two iterations is small.

  - Summary

    - The proposed mthod combines the color information into the distance metric based on ICP algorithm. The color parameters are represented by *YIQ* color model. Because it can separate the intensity(which may be affected by the light.) and the intrinsic color.

    - The distance can be computed by
      $$
      p = (x_1,x_2,x_3,\alpha_1c_1, \alpha_2c_2, \alpha_3c_3)
      $$
      Where $\alpha$ is the coefficient, and the $c$ is the measure of color.

  - Summary
    - Similar to Color-GICP, it uses color information to as the matching method. The color is represented as *Hue* value. The point is represented as $p = (x, y, z, h)$. The core idea is that the *h*  value represents the color but not sensitive to brightness and viewpoint.
  - Comments
    - ICP's drawback:
      - Too sensitve to noise and initialization;
      - Time consuming on finding the correspondence(Need to find correspondence each iteration).

  - Summary

    - Integrating color information into GICP. The pointwise color is represented by *L\*a\*b\* color space*. The point is represented as:
      $$
      p_{\alpha,i} = (x_i, y_i, z_i, \alpha L_i, \alpha a_i, \alpha b_i)^{T}
      $$
      The distance of two point is represented as :
      $$
      d_i = || p_{\alpha,i} - q_{\alpha,i}||_{2}
      $$

    The method is used in finding correspondences.

  - Pros and cons

    - Compared to GICP, the proposed method is more accurate.
    - The running time arises.

  - Comments

    - GICP reduces the distances of corresponding points in the direction of the surface normals.

  - Summary
    - The proposed method follows the iteration process of ICP method.
      - The difference: In ICP, the correspondence is provided by finding the nearest points correspondence. But in this paper, the correspondence is estimated by finding the *feature correspondence*.  The features are provided by *Binary Shape Context (BSC)*. 
      - The process of features correspondence can be summarized by: 1) Keypoints detecting; 2) computing the descriptors. 3) Computing the correspondence by miniminzing a energy function.
      - After getting the correspondence, SVD is used to compute the transformation.
  - Pros and cons
    - From the experiments, the features seem to hadle **partial overlap** well.
    - The method need involve feature correspondence computation, it is really **time consuming**.

  - First, the proposed metric is based on intersections of uniformly random straight lines set in space, which can obtain richer information and more likely to achieve the global minimum.

  - Second, our proposed metric can turn various supervised learning frameworks into unsupervised and has the
    ability to train on massive real unlabeled suitable data sets.

  - More accurate and faster than ICP, FGR.

  Tr-ICP: '*Tr*' means the '*Trimmed*', use the '*[Least Trimmed Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_trimmed_squares)*' method in the process to improve robustness.
  Pros: can converge when the **overlapping** rate is under 50%;
  cons: still need a good initial pose;

  - Summary

    - I do not understand this paper. The proposed method is based on *G-ICP*. It aims to estimate the covariance in the equation;
    - The ideas of the author show as follows:
      - The generalized ICP equation with covariance; And include the point2plane, GICP into this framework;
      - **The problem to solve** is how to get the covariance?  
    - The method proposes an *online learning* method to estimate covariance. In my view, the proposed metzhod first iteratively estimates the covariance and transformation.

  - Summary

    - Mainly about the experiments. The proposed variant of G-ICP aims to compute covariance under **sparse** point cloud. It first completes the point cloud with meshes and then computes the normal of the point using neighbour meshes.

  - Comments:

    - In many cases, the density is not high enough to compute the normal and covariance. So it is difficult for some methods to use. 

      > In addition, color information has similar properties because color is relatively sensitive to the light and viewpoint.

    - Since the raw point cloud is sparse, solely points can not represent topography, so methods like LOAM tries to extract plane and line features for registering.  But theses methods also have a drawback: the lines and planes can be easily extracted from structured environments, but are hard to find in unstructured environments.

  - Summary

    - The algorithm aims to accelerate the ICP process. Two methods are used: 

      > At a coarse resolution (i.e., with a limited number of points) ICP converges faster but with less accuracy than at a fine resolution. However, by initializing a finer-resolution ICP with the result of the coarser one, the convergence of the fine-resolution ICP is much faster than with a single-shot ICP, as the initial alignment is mostly correct. These authors also used a pre-computed list of NN to approximate the matching step. With both of these techniques, they showed a significant increase of the speed of ICP while maintaining adequate robustness

  - Summary

    <img src="notes/VGICP.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

    - The proposed is based on G-ICP(Which first computes the covariance of each point in the two point sets.) Then the GICP finds the nearest point and optimizes the cost function combined with the covariance. NDT firstly divides the raw point set into fixed grids, and computes the covariance of each grid(a distribution), then finds the nearest grid to optimize the cost function.

    - VGICP

      - Compute the covariance of each point in point sets.

      - For the fixed set, the mean value and covariance are computed together. (Maybe it can be viewed as a "distribution of distribution?").

      - Acceleration: Instead of searching the nearest point/grid. The method uses a trick of voxelization:
        $$
        voxel\_index\_a = cast\_to\_int(a_i / voxle\_resolution) \\
        voxel\_index\_b = cast\_to\_int(b_i / voxle\_resolution) \\
        $$
        In each iteration, the point in moving set will find the equal index in b to optimize.

    - Pros:

      - Run in parallel because it does not need to search the nearest point every iteration.

  - Summary
    - Symmetric ICP has a wider converge basin than point-to-plane ICP, because the zero-set of the error metric is larger than point-to-plane ICP. Compared to original symmetric ICP, the proposed method consider the rotation of the normal, making the result more accurate. 
    - The objective function is divided into *error metric* and *loss function*. One is to measure the error between two points, and the other is used to construct the objective function.
    - The loss is described by a loss function, called a robust model.

  - Summary

    - The proposed method modifies the error metric. The standard ICP uses MSE to measure the error between two point sets(The paper refer to it as *similarity*). To handle outlier and noise, the author proposes *Correntropy* with the following format:
      $$
      f = \exp{- \frac{(a_i - b_j)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
      $$

  - :question: What about the analysis about *MSE* and *correntropy function*?

  - Summary

    - Traditional ICP method uses the *Least Square* to compute the objective function. If we define the residuals as $e_1 = p_1 - q_1$ , the traditional ICP is $e_1^2 + e_2^2 + e_3^2$

      The M-ICP constructs a new objective function as:
      $$
      Obj = \sum{\rho_1(e_1)+\rho_2(e_2)+\rho_3(e_3)}

  - Summary

    - Maybe due to the density or other things, the location error of corresponding points may be anisotropic. The previous method mainly consider the location error as the isotropic error.

    - To formulate the metric error, the anisotropic consideration is combined into the steps of the iteration:
      $$
      distance:d_{new} = || W_{\vec{x}\vec{y}}(\vec{x}-\vec{y})||_{2}^2\\
      cost function = \sum_{i=1}^{M}||W_{i}(R\vec{x_i}+\vec{t}-\vec{y}_{corresponding})||_2^2
      $$
      The coefficient is related to the covariance of both inputs' covariance

    - How to compute the covariance? —— **PCA**

  - Cons:

    - PCA computes covariance consume too much time.

  - SPC problem: simultaneous pose and correspondence problem. But if given the correspondence, or given the rotation matrix, the problem becomes **convex** which is easy to solve. SPC problem is non-convex.

  - This paper regard many existing algorithms(e.g. ICP) as a kind of **E-M** algorithm, which alternatively estimate the correspondence and the transformation. The original problem is divided into two sub-problems. However, the E-M algorithms are **local optimal**.

  - Some other existing approaches(Exploiting the geomertic features thar are **inariant** to either **correspondence**? or **transformation**): [PCA](Kazhdan, Michael, Thomas Funkhouser, and Szymon Rusinkiewicz. "Shape matching and anisotropy." *ACM SIGGRAPH 2004 Papers*. 2004. 623-629.), [Mondal matching and spectural matching](M. Leordeanu and M. Hebert, "A spectral technique for correspondence problems using pairwise constraints", *ICCV*, vol. 2, pp. 1482-1489, 2005.    &&    S. Sclaroff and A. Pentland, "Model matching for correspondence and recognition", *PAMI*, June 1995.)

  - The core idea of this paper is the theory of **Lipschitz optimization**.

  - The above problems mentioned above:

    - If the correspondence is fixed, the problem can be solved by: RANSAC, [quaternion method](B. Horn, "Closed-form solution of absolute orientation using unit quatemions", *JOSA-A*, vol. 4, pp. 629-642, April 1987.) [colsed-form1](D. W. Eggert, A. Lorusso and R. B. Fisher, "Estimating 3-d rigid body transformations: a comparison of four major algorithms", *Machine Vision and Applications*, vol. 9, pp. 272-290, 1997.) [closed-form2]( N. Ohta and K. Kanatani, "Optimal estimation of three-dimensional rotation and reliability evaluation", *ECCV*, pp. 175-187, June 1998.)
    - if the Rotation is fixed, the correspondence can also be solved(Here I do not write here, it can be regarded as a pure mathematical problem)

  - To globally optimize the problem, two ways can be considered:

    - Search all the permutations, and then solve the rotation. This idea is simple and effiective, but the cons is that if the input's size is large, the searching space's size is $n!$.
    - Search the rotation space and slove foe the correspondence, which uses the Lipschitz optimization and Brounch-and-bound algorithm.

  - For the brounch-and-bound algorithm, in my view, it estimate the lower bound of each interval and choose the lower bound, and iteratively search the space until converge.

    :question: The details of the algorithm I have not understood.

  - Pros and cons:

    - pros: Global optimal, insensitive to the initialization.
    - cons: 1) Time consuming. 2) Senstive to the outlier. 3) The algorithm complexity is unkown.

  - Can be considered as the pre-paper for the Go-ICP

  - Summary

    - The proposed method call them *point-to-line* metric, but the formulation is similar to *poin-to-plane*. In the paper, the author explicitly says that the proposed method is based on the *point-to-plane* formulation.

    - The difference between the proposed method and *point-to-plane* method is the optimization. Different from *least square solution*, the proposed method uses a closed-form solution to optimize which makes the converge quicker.

    - For **optimization**, 

      > A classical approach involves the computation of all the stationary points (among which there is the global minimum). This approach is used by Censi [13] for the global resolution of the 2D registration problem, reducing the problem to solving a 4-th order polynomial equation.

      > ***Convex Global 3D Registration With Lagrangian Duality***
      >

      The proposed method utilizes the ***Lagrange’s multipliers* to optimize the formulation.** And the rotation parameter is expressed in a different way.

      The proposed method also proposes a search algorithm to find the correspondence.

    - Summary

      - This papar proposes a partition depending on the points' semantic lables. (1DNT or many NDTs?)
        - The semantic labels are *edge* and *plane*.
        - The point will be put a value reveals confidence.
        - :question: How many NDTs will be constructed?
      - The registration process does not find the closet NDT, but find the NDTs with the same label. 

    - Pros

      - Fitst, the points with no labels will be filtered out, resulting less points and faster registration. 
      - Second, only registering the NDTs with the same label will result int more accurate result.

    - Experiments

      - The experiments are conducted on KITTI(SLAM) and ETH. 

        - KITTI provides the ground truth and provide the evaluation metric. **Features:** SLAM, outdoor, large overlap.

          **Do we need to modify the dataset?**
